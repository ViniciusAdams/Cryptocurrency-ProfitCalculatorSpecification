Qt Library:

PyQt6 is a Python library that provides bindings to the Qt framework, which is a powerful and widely used C++ framework for developing applications with a graphical user interface (GUI).
Qt Widgets:

PyQt6 provides a wide range of Qt widgets that can be used to create graphical user interfaces. These widgets include buttons, labels, text fields, calendars, and more.
QWidget:

The QWidget class is the base class for all graphical user interface objects in PyQt6. It can act as a container for other widgets.
QApplication:

The QApplication class represents the application itself and manages its execution. You typically create an instance of QApplication at the beginning of your program.
QMainWindow:

QMainWindow is a special type of widget that often serves as the main window for your application. It can contain a menu bar, toolbars, and a central widget.
Layouts:

PyQt6 provides layout managers like QVBoxLayout and QHBoxLayout to organize widgets within a container. Layouts help manage the positioning and sizing of widgets.
Signals and Slots:

PyQt6 uses the concept of signals and slots for handling events and connecting user interactions to specific actions or functions. Widgets emit signals when events occur, and these signals can be connected to slots, which are functions that respond to the events.
Event Handling:

You can override methods to handle events like mouse clicks, key presses, and more for custom behavior.
Custom Widgets:

You can create your custom widgets by subclassing existing Qt widgets or by building entirely new widgets.
Qt Designer:

Qt Designer is a graphical tool that allows you to design your interface visually and then export it to Python code that you can use with PyQt6.
Threading:

PyQt6 supports threading, allowing you to perform background tasks without freezing the GUI.
Qt Core:

PyQt6 includes Qt Core functionality, such as data structures, streams, and event handling.
Qt Network:

PyQt6 provides networking capabilities to create applications that communicate over networks.
Qt SQL:

PyQt6 supports database access using Qt SQL, making it easy to connect to and work with databases.
Qt Multimedia:

You can use Qt Multimedia for audio and video playback within your applications.
Qt WebEngine:

Qt WebEngine allows you to embed web content in your applications using the WebEngineView widget.
Cross-Platform:

PyQt6 is cross-platform, which means you can develop applications for Windows, macOS, Linux, and other platforms.
Resources and Documentation:

PyQt6 has extensive documentation, including examples and tutorials, to help you learn and use its features effectively.
